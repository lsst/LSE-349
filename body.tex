\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
This is in the file intro.tex. Put your text here.

The appendices for the \appref{sec:bib} and \appref{sec:acronyms} are defined in the main file LDM-000.tex.

The main bibliography file is in the lsst-texmf/texmf/bibtex/bib so you can refer to documents such as \citeds{LDM-294} (from lsst.bib)  or papers like \cite{2008arXiv0805.2366I} (from refs\_ads.bib). You may make a PR to add new refs to these files.

Acronyms like BOE and BAC will be picked up by generateAcronyms.py which is in lsst-texmf/bin -- that needs to be in the PATH.
